Revision history for Perinci-CmdLine-Inline

0.04    2015-06-12 (PERLANCAR)

	- Replace Module::FatPack with Module::DataPack.


0.03     2015-06-11 (PERLANCAR)

         - Use Test::Perinci::CmdLine test suite.

         - Reduce startup overhead by using Module::FatPack and moving most
           subroutines to fatpacked modules. 'script --help' or 'script
           --version' now only spends 0.020-0.025s on my PC, and 0.022s of that
           is loading/compiling Getopt::Long. So Getopt::Long is now the main
           overhead and I'll perhaps be looking for a way to reduce this
           further.

         - Support pass_cmdline_object.

         - Add the other Perinci::CmdLine::Base attributes as arguments,
           although currently they do nothing, for compatibility with the other
           Perinci::CmdLine backends.


0.02     2015-05-25 (PERLANCAR)

         - No functional changes.

         - Reupload, avoid PAUSE indexer for embedded packages
           (Text::Table::Tiny, Data::Check::Structure).


0.01     2015-05-25 (PERLANCAR)

         - First release.
